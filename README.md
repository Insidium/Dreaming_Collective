## The Problem

I grew up in Alice Springs, Northern Territory, from the late 1980's to the late 1990's. While there I witnessed firsthand the beauty and complexity of the indigenous people and their art (namely Arrente nation). However, among so many other issues in the community, I also witnessed the outright exploitation of the region's artists. I came to learn that these abhorrent practices have been experienced nation-wide.

As the market for authentic indigenous art grew, so did the business of profiting off the hard work of the communities who created these pieces for themselves and the consumer. Without knowledge of the art industry or the confidence to negotiate a suitable agreement, the artists were often taken advantage of and provided with very little recognition. It was common to see artists receiving a tiny margin from the sale (as low as 10%) or being paid in drugs, communal housing with other artists and second-hand cars.

It wasn't until 2007 that a Senate enquiry investigated properly and confirmed what communities had been experiencing for decades. The enquiry ruled that the Federal Government establish an 'Indigenous Art Code' and an administrative committee with the aim of ending these practices. This only came about in 2010. This was a step in the right direction, but the Code is still _voluntary_. Exploitative practices still occur and are often left unchecked.

The nature of the trade of indigenous art has improved since my childhood, but there is still a long way to go. For example: a common profit share agreement in 'ethical' galleries is 60% for the artist and 40% for the gallery (covering wages, premises, overheads etc). While this type of transaction can be justified due to gallery business costs, around 50% of artists still earn \$7,300 or less from their art each year.

There are very few ways for artists to take control of their craft and its sale. There are also very few ways for the consumer to ensure that they are purchasing authentic indigenous art and that the proceeds are being ethically distributed to the artists and their communities. There needs to be a way for both to occur and put the power back in the hands of the people.

## Why is solving this problem important?

Indigenous art isn't just about creativity, it is a direct link to their ancient culture and a way to pass this along to future generations. As indigenous people do not have a traditional "written history" prior to the interpreted and incomplete documentation by Europeans, this fundamental form of expression is crucial to the preservation of their past and the persistence of their culture into the future. Further, it is essential that indigenous people be provided with equal opportunities to provide for themselves and their communities via their work, both financially and culturally.

The upsides of providing a solution to this issue are numerous, such as:

- Providing the appropriate level of ownership over their creations by indigenous artists
- Providing financial freedom and empowerment via a self-generated income stream
- Providing safeguards against the future exploitation of artists
- Providing channels for the production of authentic indigenous art direct from the source
- Providing assurance that any transactions with potential customers are ethical
- Providing a way for artists to feed this empowerment back into their communities to enable the improvement of infrastructure and a marked increase to quality of life

The fact that anyone is able to take advantage of our First Nations people as they create something so integral to their identity is horrendous. At best it is gross negligence, at worst it is outright fraud. This must be remedied and we have a responsibility to help. In fact, we should be proud to drive the change.
